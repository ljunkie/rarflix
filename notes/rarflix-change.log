    * Release Notes screen is now a scrollable paragraph with all release notes (firmware 4.3+)

#2.8.9-dev  (2013-12-05)

    * Rotten Tomatoes performance
        - stage one: cache data in current screen. Do not re-query rotten tomatoes on every click right/left if already loaded.
	- stage two: Rotten Tomatoes Proxy server added - maintained by me thanks to AWS+Squid

    * v2.8.8 regressions fixes
        - image size issues on springboard - we will no always use a 'larger' images than the grid for the SpringBoard
        - images were not refreshed correctly from Episode Details Screen (springboard) to Episode List Screen (posterscreen)
        - other image logic cleanup


#2.8.8-dev  (2013-12-04)

    * Slideshow Overlay
        - it was lonely (top left: date of photo, top right: count - 1 of 100, body: Title of photo)
        - overlay toggle (down button) is now more reponsive. It can be toggled frequently on the current image.

    * Cast & Crew
       - cast & crew search screen didn't use the preferred Grid Style (Portrait).
       - removed "clips" from Cast & Crew search. The clip results were invalid.
       - focus the first row on a Cast & Screen search after selecting a cast member. (fix for real this time)


    * Misc Fixes
        - larger BoB (grid description background) used on screens when it shouldn't have been.
        - tv episodic view will show episode images instead of number (unfocused content).
        - trailer thumbnails on poster screen should use landscape instead of portrait.
        - crash: when pressing play on remote from a photo directory, whose children are also all directories.
        - some images would break after being refresh (missing authtoken). This would cause broken images (gray poster) or the image would gray/broken and reappear.
	- current bandwidth under remote/local settings will not show invalid if empty
	- current bandwidth will show mbps > 999kbps

#2.8.7-dev (2013-12-03)

    * Fix Images Sizes (globally) - the Roku specifically wants images of a certain size or it has to resize internally
        - custom icons will now use the correct size based on the Screen Style (grid/poster screens)
        - all over icons/images/thumbnails will use the correct size based on the Screen Style
        - changes above should speed up the display (roku will not have to internally resize images 99% of the time)

    * Music Section Style ( on the list to make this a toggle, no eta )
        - change from flat-square (the tiny 7x3 row) to flat-landscape (5x3 row)
        - all subsections in music library section will use the 5x3 now. Before it was "random"

    * TV Season Posters ( when using TV Seasons Posters vs the TV Show Poster )
        - TV Season Posters: In some scenarios the Season poster was being used when it should have been the actual episode thumb
        - TV Season Posters: sometimes the parentThumb (season thumb) isn't exposed via the PMS API. Query the API for it.

    * Grid Description background (BoB) was too short in the new Portrait mode (roku bug) - text could overflow. Fixed with custom background

    * Toggle added to change "Grid Updates/Speed"
	- default is FULL ( what people should use )
        - Partial will only reload the focused item
        - Partial will be less dynamic but very quick -- I would suggest not to use this unless needed

    * Grid Reloading (slow grid screen issues) logic updated again ( will yet again improve the speed of the grid )
        - Always full reload the onDeck row
        - Only do a full reload once every 90 seconds. You can now enter focused item and return to grid without speed issues. Same goes for using the * remote key.
        - Check the focused item index against the PMS api. If keys do not match, a full reload will be forced (even before the 90 seconds) - Usually due to marking an item as watched/unwatched or newly scanned items are inserted
        - Full Grid screens will always get a full reload. It's fast enough since it only load 5 items per row

    * HUD would show "invalid" when originallyAvailableAt (Release Date) was empty. Display the Year or leave it empty if invalid.

    * TV Episodes Screen
        - TV Series episodes: use 16x9 for thumbs instead of 4x3. Toggle created, end user can change between 4x3 or 16x9
        - Toggle to show Episode Images instead of a "blank images with a number" for unfocused episodes

      * Addition to Grid Style/Size Toggle: "Portrait (tall)" fit's the Plex Movie Posters better ( when used with Grid Display Mode: Photo )

      * Photo section now defaults to landscape (Grid: 5x3) -- used to be 'landscape 16x9'
      * Toggle to change photo sections from landscape to Portrait/Landscape/Landscape 16x9
      * Fix: Grid Style/Size toggle only affected the Full Grid. Now it toggles Grids for Movies/Shows

    Use Season Poster when viewing a season/episode ( recently added, recently releases, on deck, etc.. )
      * Toggle allowed to set it back to 'Show'
      * Official Channel only allowed 'Show'

    Firmware 3.x bugfixes ( first gen roku )

#2.8.4-test (2013-11-12)

Fixing Lag - Grid Optimiziations
    * speed improvements for paginated dataloader - trade offs included - when re-loading grid rows
       - basically - do not fully reload focused row and do not invalidate every out of focus row
       - load the next out of screen row ( first 8 items )
       - reload selected item ONLY ( in every row )
       - OnDeck will always be fully reloaded ( it's normally small in size and is more dynamic then others ) 

 Others:
    * Toggle: Initial release of GLOBALLY disabling the Grid POP Out ( description bubble on bottom left ) : prefs / section display / grid pop out 
    * timestamp logging ( if time stamp is not logged, it's due to temporary debug messages - disregard )

### 2.6.12-test (2013-09-25)

* Update breadcrumb on the Global (home screen) Recently Added content.

* (*) "Info Button" now works in Video Details Screen
    - It will activate the "more..." button dialog
     - In the dialog, the (*) will close dialog
    - Initial addition, so let me know your thoughts

* Cast and Crew for Movies: Check out the MORE button / "Cast & Crew"
    - Display a list of Actors/Directors/Producers and Writers for selected Movie
    - Persons poster will be displayed if your PMS has a URL for them (depends on the scaper)
    - Select a person to get a list of movies/content with them
    - Listed content will show Server/Section name on the top right
    - NOTE: people searches only work in the PMS by sections for now
            This also doesn't work for TV shows yet. That's a PMS thing..

* Trailers: multiple enhancements
    - Play All Button (plays from selected video to the end of the list)
    - Navigation - You can click left/right in the Video Details Screen for the previous or next trailer
    - Video Length is now available. HUD has End Time & Time Watched
    - Directly Play a video in the list with the Play Button
    - Breadcrumbs are now updated ( empty before )

* Toggle to search Trailers/Rotten Tomatoes by Title or ORIGINAL title [default: title]

* Remote Logging: If enabled, they will not go to PlexServers any more.
    - I suggest to never use this unless you are testing with me

* Show the option to Hide Rows in the preferred Row Order

* Fix: updated logic in the more dialog for mark was watched/unwated; only show watched/unwatched when it make sense!
* Fix: Breadcrumbs updated when selecting "All Seasons of {ShowTitle}" or "Season {#}" insead of just diplaying "Series"
* Fix: Recently Added (unwatched), Recently Released (unwatched) rows could not be hidden
* Fix: Depending on how one entered a TV Episode, the more button wouldn't exist due to data missing from the PMS response. We now obtain the needed info another way when missing.


### 2.6.11-test

* RARflix Preferences section: my mods that haven't made it into the Official Channel will usually be here
* Hide Rows: you can now hide rows instead of reordering them, which you can still do too. ( not per section though )
* Ability to toggle all modes ( well most of them )
* TV Titles watched status: will include (watched) or ( # of # watched) or (#)  for TV shows. Not really new, but some fixes added and of course a Toggle to turn it off
* Toggle for the Clock
* Added 2 more rows: (only applies to movies)  -- TV is possible, but the PMS is currently way to slow to filter results
   1) Recenlty Released (unwatched)
   2) Recenlty Added (unwatched)
* HUD: display current time and time watched when video duration is unavailable ( usually queue videos, some channels, trailers )
* SlideShow Overlay toggle:  toggle for text overlay during slideshow (down button) -- request
* Merged Schuyler's updates from the PlexTest (v2.6.9) channel: http://forums.plexap...ku/#entry465759

* fix: Remove "invalid" from HUD when Release Date is unavailable ( usually queue videos, some channels, trailers )
* fix: Ability to delete queue items (only affected rarflix/rarflixtest )
* fix: When browsing the global on deck (non shared users) entering a movie would allow you to click left or right.
       If the next option was not a movie, you were given the option to "play" the content which would result in a crash.
       Now we just limit the ability to click left or right - not really a complete fix, but will stop an accidental crash.
       (bug seen in official channel too)
* fix: Crash when clicking the play button on a Photo folder (bug was only present in rarflixtest)
